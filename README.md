# BinaryClassificationModel
This is a simple PyTorch machine learning model for binary classification on the make_circles dataset! This model is designed to classify data points into one of two classes, based on their features and patterns. The make_circles dataset is a toy dataset generated by scikit-learn that consists of two classes of data points arranged in circular shapes.

# Training the Model
The Model can be train by running the make_circle_classification_model.py file. This will train the model on a 1000 samples for 3000 epochs. The trained model is then saved in the models folder.
